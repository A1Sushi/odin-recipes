    <h2>Easy Jajangmyeon (Korean noodles in black bean sauce) recipe!</h2>
        <p>Jajangmyeon [자장면] is a popular noodle dish served with black bean sauce, which consists of Korean Black Bean Paste or salty black soybean paste [Chunjang], diced pork (or other kinds of meat) and vegetables. You can find it easily at a Korean Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>While there are many theories about when it was first introduced to Korea, officially the first known Jajangmyeon is from a restaurant called Gonghwachun (공화춘) in Chinatown of Incheon, Korea back in 1905. It was introduced by Chinese merchants but the flavor evolved to suit Korean taste buds over time.</p>
