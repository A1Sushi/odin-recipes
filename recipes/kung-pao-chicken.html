    <h1>Healthy Kung Pao Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../images/Kung-Pao-Chicken-Picture.jpg" alt="Bowl of Kung Pao Chicken on top of rice">
        <p>Healthy Kung Pao Chicken is full of all the flavor of the classic Chinese take-out dish, tastes amazing, and is a meal you can feel good about feeding your family. </p>
        <p>The level of spiciness in this dish is really up to you and it can be as mild or as spicy as you like. I recommend starting with a small amount of Sriracha and adding more as you go. You can always add more when the dish is finished or people can add their own. The same goes for the black pepper, start small and adjust up.</p>
        <p>If you prefer dark meat, boneless skinless chicken thighs are a great option in this recipe. And for vegetarians, tofu works really well too.</p>
        <p>Too much sodium? Replace the soy sauce with coconut amino instead. They have about 65% less sodium that traditional soy sauce.</p>
        <p>When it comes time to serve this dish, I usually serve it piled high on a bowl of steamed brown rice or cauliflower rice with a side of steamed veggies. Broccoli is the obvious choice but bok-choy, sugar snap peas, and green beans are all good</p>
    <h3>What is Kung Pao sauce?</h3>
        <p>Kung pao, also known as Gong Bao or Kung Po, is a Sichuan dish that is known for being sweet and spicy at the same time. It is traditionally made with soy sauce, sugar, dark Chinese vinegar, Sichuan peppercorns, and dried red chilies. However this version is made with all the same flavors but easier ingredients you are more likely to find in your home or local grocery store. It isn't an authentic Kung Pao chicken but is definitely delicious.</p>
