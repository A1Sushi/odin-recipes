    <h1>Chinese Tomato Egg Stir-Fry</h1>
        <img src="../images/Tomato-Egg-Stirfry-img.jpg" alt="Tomato Egg Curry on top of some rice">
        <p>This is an iconic dish that many Chinese people grow up eating for breakfast.</p>
        <p>The most memorable version was one where the egg was creamy (as opposed to that scrambled egg texture). The creamy egg mixed-in seamlessly with the flavorful tomato sauce – making it look like a curry.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Make Stir-Fried Tomato Mixture</h3>
            <li>Cut 2 whole tomatoes in half. Remove the stem portion from both. Then cut into wedges. Afterwards, cut the wedges in half again - so it turns bite-sized.</li>
            <li>Cut green onion stalks into thin pieces. Set aside the white portion for frying in oil. And then green portion for garnish.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Make Egg Mixture</h3>
            <li>Crack 5 eggs into a bowl. Then season with salt (½ teaspoon!), as well as few shakes of black pepper. Whisk thoroughly - so the yolk and white turns into one.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Make Starch Mixture</h3>
            <li>Mix Corn Starch Powder (1 teaspoon!) with Water (2 Tablespoons). Set aside for later.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Stir-Fry Tomatoes</h3>
            <li>Place Vegetable Oil (2 Tablespoon) into a wok. Place on medium-high heat. Then add in the Green Onion (white portion). Once the pieces start to sizzle, add in the tomato chunks.</li>
            <li>After you add-in the tomatoes, stir-fry it around for 1 minute. Then add in Ketchup (3 Tablespoons) and Sugar (2 teaspoons!). Then, add in ¼ cup of Water (60 ml). </li>
            <li>Once it comes back up to a boil, give the starch mixture another quick stir. Then add-in the starch mixture into the tomatoes and give everything a few stirs. Turn off the heat and place the tomato mixture into a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Quickly wash the wok and dry it off with a paper towel.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Stir-fry Egg Mixture</h3>
            <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of cooking oil into the wok. (Make sure there is a small layer of oil - feel free to add another Tablespoon if needed). Place on medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add in the beaten eggs. After 10 seconds - the egg will start to set at the edges (reference picture). Immediately, add in the stir-fried tomato mixture.</li>
            <li>Now gently fold the egg that have set at the edges, inwards - into the tomatoes. Repeat this step - this will make large, fluffy egg curds.</li>
            <li>At this stage, if you have chicken stock powder on hand - add in ½ teaspoon (!) Skip this ingredient, if you don't have.</li>
            <li>Now, gently break up the large egg pieces into the tomato mixture with your spatula. Stir-fry everything for 15-20 seconds more. Then turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Plate and garnish with green onion (and cilantro if you like!)</li>
            <li>Serve with a bowl of fresh hot rice! Bon Appetit! </li>
