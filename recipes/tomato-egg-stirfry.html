    <h2>Easy Jajangmyeon (Korean noodles in black bean sauce) recipe!</h2>
        <p>Jajangmyeon [자장면] is a popular noodle dish served with black bean sauce, which consists of Korean Black Bean Paste or salty black soybean paste [Chunjang], diced pork (or other kinds of meat) and vegetables. You can find it easily at a Korean Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>While there are many theories about when it was first introduced to Korea, officially the first known Jajangmyeon is from a restaurant called Gonghwachun (공화춘) in Chinatown of Incheon, Korea back in 1905. It was introduced by Chinese merchants but the flavor evolved to suit Korean taste buds over time.</p>

        <ol>
            <h3>How to Make Jajangmyeon</h3>
                <li>Pre heat the wok until the bottom is heated well. Add the lard (or cooking oil) and melt it in the wok. Add the black bean paste and stir it constantly on medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes. (Try not to burn it.) Add the brown sugar and stir it for an additional 2 to 3 mins. </li>
                <li>Scoop out the black bean paste (without the oil) and set it aside. Leave the oil in the wok to use in the next step.</li>
                <li>Add the pork into the wok and stir until the pork is half cooked. </li>
                <li>Add the onion, zucchini, and potato and stir until all are 1/3 cooked (for 3 to 5 mins). </li>
                <li>Add the mushrooms and cabbages and stir for 2-3 mins. </li>
                <li> Add the black bean paste (from step 2) into the wok and mix it in with vegetables. Stir for 1 to 2 mins. </li>
                <li>Add the chicken stock, water and rice wine then simmer it for 5 to 7 mins on medium heat. (Cover the wok with a lid if possible. This will make the cooking process faster.) </li>
                <li> Add the slurry into the wok then stir it. (This will thicken the black sauce. It is the final stage of making the black bean sauce.) </li>
                <li>(While working on step 7) Boil some water in a pot and add the noodles when it starts to boil. Boil them until the noodles are cooked (for 3 to 5 mins). </li>
                <li>Rinse the noodles in cold water and drain. Put them into a serving bowl/plate. </li>
                <li>Add the black bean sauce (from the step 8) on top of the noodles. You can serve it as it is or decorate it with some cucumber slices, green peas or sweet corn or hardboiled egg. </li>
                <li>Mix the sauce and the noodles well with chopsticks. Dig in. (It is ideal to have them with some (yellow) pickled radish. Apparently, it helps digestion. Also, eat it up quickly before the noodles get swollen.)</li>
        </ol>
