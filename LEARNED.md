6. Commit Messages on Github?
   ##### How to write a meaningful commit message?
       - https://cbea.ms/git-commit/
   ##### Why meaningful commit messages are important
        - This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.
        - There will come a time when you are working on a project and you FINALLY get something just right (this would be a good time to commit), and then maybe 30 seconds to a few days later it breaks. You have no idea what you changed, everything looks to be the same and you don’t remember editing that line, but alas, it isn’t working how you want it anymore. You’d be able to go back through your commit history and either revert your code back to the last commit you made when you first got that part working or go back and see what your code looked like at that point in time.
    ##### When to commit
        - Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code
        - This means, make a commit if you get a piece of code you are working on to function like you want it to, fix a typo, or fix a bug.

## Possible Improvements [! = added]
- Adding link directing back to main page!
- Using italicized and bold text(s)!
- Instead of skills up to this point, just list topics you learned that you will implement into the project 
- Summarizing is a waste of time because there are already links on each lessons, just learn how to access them quickly for documentation
- Using link targets to open link in new window & tab!
- Using conventional commits to have an organized template to follow!
### Naming 
- Use shorter names for folders because you have to reference them
    - js, css, img
- Use hyphen instead of space when naming
- Avoid capitals 
- Avoid numbers
